# Assignment 4 - Creating Tweeter (A Twitter Clone)

## Author

Evan Westcomb

## Description

You will be creating a social website called Tweeter that will allow users to
be able to make posts called Twits that other users can view.
Users of the site will be able to make Twits that contain both text and
pictures via a URL field to a picture. Users can also like and unlike Twits that
other users make. As with all the assignments thus far, all views should be Class-Based Views.
In short, there should be a lot of similarity with what we did with in-class-4.

Rather than trying to have a lengthy worded description of what is required, I have opted to provide
a lot of pictures to help you see what is expected. So, be sure to look at the screenshots below.
If you have any questions about anything, don't hesitate to ask.

Add required files and settings for publishing the site on Heroku. Fully hosting is worth extra credit. If doing so, publish the site on Heroku with a project name of "cis218-assignment-4-{your_name}" and submit the URL for the site to Canvas as the submission for this assignment. Regardless, have your most recent commit pushed up to GitHub.

Ensure that you have a `requirements.txt` file with your required packages. I will not grade the assignment if I can't restore the packages easily!

The program should allow the following functionality:

1. A Custom User model that adds a date of birth field.
2. Full user authentication so that only authenticated users can use the site.
3. Sign up and authentication forms / views so that users can authenticate with the system.
4. Ability for users to be able to change and reset their password. (Just use the same fake SMTP as the in-class.)
5. A private profile page where a user can update details about themselves. (username, fname, lname, email, date of birth)
6. A Dashboard for each user that will show all the Twits in the system listed with the most recent ones first.
7. Pages / forms to be able to CUD a Twit. Update and Delete should be limited to the person that made the twit.
8. New Twits should allow both text and URL for a picture. Image URL can then be used with a img tag to render the image. Don't try to use an ImageField. Use URLField.
9. A Public Profile page for each user that shows all the Twits for that user. Similar to dashboard feed, but only contains all Twits for that specific user. Also most recent first.
10. Ability for users to like or unlike a particular Twit that someone has made using AJAX.
11. Ability for users to add a comment on Twits. This will only be create functionality. No need for update / delete.
12. Sufficient automated tests to verify all functionality.
13. Files and Settings correct for publishing to Heroku.
14. Ensure `requirements.txt` is included in your project.
15. If doing Extra Credit, URL submitted to Canvas as Assignment Submission.

### Documentation

Documentation should include the following for this, and all future assignments:
* Comments at the top of each source code file that you add or edit with:
  * Your Name
  * Class
  * Date
* A comment after the definition of each method describing what it does. I would highly suggest you use the ''' (triple quote) method for the comment.
* Comments in the rest of the code where it isn't obvious what is going on. (I prefer above the line comments vs at the end of the line because who likes to horizontally scroll, but either will work)

### Database Requirements
Here are the requirements for the database in an ERD. There are other authentication related tables that I did not include but are provided via Django's auth system. The Users table is the only one that really needed to be shown since there are so many relations between Users and our other tables. There are no relations between the other authentication tables and our tables, which is why I omitted them.

**NOTE:** For the URL field on the Twit model, you are not using an ImageField. Those are extremely hard to properly set up. Perhaps if the semester was twice as long we could consider. Instead, you are simply loading images via a URLField. Meaning that the user will provide a URL to an image that already exists on the internet. This will be WAY easier for you to implement. If you have questions about it, ask.

### Screenshots

Here are some images of the non-admin pages that I made for my key. This is more or less to give you an idea as to what the general concept is in case the written description is not clear. I realize that your assignment may not end up as elaborate in style as mine, so don't feel as though it needs to visually match mine exactly. I am looking for the general concept though. I will also mention that I used Bootstrap to do my styling.

#### Non-required features shown in Screenshots
* Relative time since Twit was created
* Number of twits a user has made
* Profile image for the user

### Bootstrap

Remember that you can see all available Bootstrap examples here:

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/

In addition, you can find the documentation for Bootstrap here:

### Notes
> [!IMPORTANT]
> * All Views must be Class-Based Views. Function-Based views will not be graded.
> * All Templates should be in a `templates` directory in the root of the project. Templates in any other location will not be graded.
> * Ensure that you have a `requirements.txt` file with your required packages. I will not grade the assignment if I can't restore the packages easily!
> * Your number of commits should be similar to the number we did with the in-class work or more. You need to show me your progression through the development process of your assignment. Submitting an assignment with only 1 or 2 commits does not do this. You need more. Failure to have enough commits will result in a "zero".
> * Assignment work should be similar to the work we did with the in-class work. If a submitted assignment is wildly different than the in-class work and no references to resources that were used are provided via this README file, I will assume that you did not write the code yourself and instead stole it from somewhere without giving credit. Which will result in a "zero". Even if you plan to use outside references and list them in this README, be sure you are not plagiarizing anyone's work. See the syllabus for more information.
